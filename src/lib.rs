//!Floor is supposed to be a simple and lightweight foundation for web applications written in Rust. Its API is inspired by the popular express framework for JavaScript.
//!
//!Some of the features are:
//!
//!* Easy handlers: A handler is just a function that takes a `Request` and `ResponseWriter`
//!* Variables in routes. Just write `my/route/:someid`
//!* Easy parameter access: `request.params.get(&"someid")`
//!* simple wildcard routes: `/some/*/route`
//!* double wildcard routes: `/a/**/route`
